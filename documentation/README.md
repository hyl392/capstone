## <a name="week1"></a> Week 1
### The week full of question marks, more question marks, and more question marks
Scrapping an idea and coming up with a completely new one is honestly kind of scary. I'm just glad that this process literally came before Capstone Seminar even began. Due to not being on campus and having access to a "large" open space and without the materials that I usually would have access to, I decided to switch from a physical project to producing something that is smaller in scale and more feasible for me to accomplish from home.   

### Inspiration
Being home for the summer and currently as Fall semester starts made one thing really clear for me: time doesn't stop for anyone. 

Since as far as my memory extends, my grandma has always been an amazing cook and displayed her skills evidently every time we would visit by cooking up a big feast. Sometimes, not even the dining table could fit all the dishes. In the past few years, although her love for cooking holds strong, her ability to do so has slowly diminished. Most often now, instead of cooking herself, she would watch on the side and guide (more like dictate) the cooking. 

I want to document this love of hers in a way that is more than a recipe book.   

### Idea
A recipe book of my grandma's famous dishes accompanied with a mobile app that includes an AR/image scanning feature. Both the book and the app could be standalone projects, but combining the two together brings more features e.g. scanning a page in the book --> directs to a step-by-step video of cooking the dish

### Class discussion
Sharing my idea with the class was very helpful because it allowed me to think about details a lot more deeply, especially when it comes to thinking about my project's audience.
* how can I include a storytelling aspect to my project? how do I make the story more than applicable to myself/family? do I need the story to be applicable to anybody beyond?
* who is my audience exactly? perhaps Taiwanese/Hakka students living abroad or descendants living abroad

Ideas I will look more into:
* acute APP --> artists with AR pieces
* social practice art --> bringing food to galleries

### Prototype
For this week, one of my goals is to come up with a list of dishes that I want to potentially include in my project. In the style of my grandma, recipes will be from all courses, culminating to a full course meal. Below is are pictures of lists (in Chinese but will be translated!) of main courses, soups, desserts that I could include.

I also wanted to get things started on the layout and features of the app that I want to create. I've started to look into creating prototypes of mobile apps through InVision Studio and hope to get started using this once I have some features planned out and a potential layout.

### Next steps 

1. Narrow down options, organise filming and phototaking of the dishes    
1. Work out app details, what I want to include in the app as features and layout -- document this    
1. Work out the logistics of making the book, I'm thinking of using Adobe InDesign or something of the sort

### The week full of question marks, more question marks, and more question marks, squared
The feedback that I received last week was pretty helpful in making me think more on what it is exactly that I want to achieve with my project. Although this is something I'm still trying to work out, Gabi and Alex really made me realise how much the audience matters in our projects. The questions about who my audience is that stemmed from our first Capstone Seminar class still looms over my project. I think for now it will be a looming question, and it won't be until I really get to the more intense designing part of the project for me to decide the answer to that question. 

### Prototype
For this week, my goal was to start wireframing and thinking about how I want my features to be laid out for the app and which interactions I wanted to include. I'm still trying to get my hands on technology that I think would really help me in my design process, but in the meantime brainstorming and wireframing will be my main focus points. 

Here are some of the wireframes that I'm working on and short descriptions of the elements on the pages:

### Next steps 
The next steps are roughly the same from last week's and are as follows:

1. Narrow down options, organise filming and phototaking of the dishes    
1. Work out app details, what I want to include in the app as features and layout -- keep working on the wireframes    
1. Work out the logistics of making the book, I'm thinking of using Adobe InDesign or something of the sort

### The week where I started putting things together
The feedback that I received last week gave me a lot of new ideas for features that I could potentially include in my project. Particularly, adding audio in the app to potentially allow the experience of using the app to be more nostalgic and sharing memories associated with the recipes, perhaps through an AR version of a re-telling of the stories. 

### Prototype
This week, I started to use InVision Studio to visualise a part of my app that I had drawn up last week. I focused on the Main Section #2 and #3 (seen in the above photos from last week's prototype). This is obviously a very rough idea with minimal design elements of what I want the structure to kind of be like.

Here is a video of the interactions that I have between the two pages so far:

### Prototype
This week, I continued to work on my prototype that I started to work on in Week 3. However, to showcase the progress that I made this week, after talking to Heather during our meeting, I wanted to document the some of the ways I want users to enjoy the experiences that I am creating. I decided that a fun way to do so would be through a comic strip. 

<img src="https://github.com/hyl392/capstone/blob/master/documentation/images/week4_1.jpg" width="50%"><img src="https://github.com/hyl392/capstone/blob/master/documentation/images/week4_2.jpg" width="50%"><img src="https://github.com/hyl392/capstone/blob/master/documentation/images/week4_3.jpg" width="50%"> 

I first wanted to try and draw using the iPad, but without an Apple Pencil I realised how hard this was and so decided to do so on paper. However, I couldn't manage to scan the pages clear enough and so had to draw some bits over again on the iPad. I hope that the quality doesn't hinder the ability to understand the comic though!

## <a name="week5"></a>Week 5
### Reflection/questions/ideas from meeting with Heather that I must note down
* Is the book redundant if the app can do everything that the book does and even more? What is it that is highlighted in the book that is not in the app?
* Is it a recipe app or an AR experience? If it's an AR experience, what exactly is the experience?
* Overlayed cooking --> potential AR experience?

### How researching artists for the artist paper inspired me (copied from my reflection in my paper)
From Thiel in particular, the idea of allowing users to interact with the augmented images to find out the information that the experience was created to reveal in the first place is an interesting concept. The users are in charge of their experiences and have freedom in choosing the trajectories and the ways in which they view the experience, however, the experiences are already carefully curated by the artist Thiel herself. I think that allowing users some sort of “own discovery” makes the process a lot more memorable because the users retain as an active viewer even while the AR experience is running (more than just moving the screen around). I definitely want to use this concept to expose some sort of information, not necessarily injustices and social and environmental challenges like Thiel and Schafer, but perhaps some historical or “immaterial heritage” like Gheorghiu and Stefan did. From Gheorghiu and Stefan, I really like the idea of having fractals where a series of new images will replace the original to reveal something even deeper or new. With regards to how I can introduce these ideas into my Capstone, I’m envisioning having a process where when users scan an image of a dish in the recipe book, a series of augmented options pop out. For example, one of these options would be to navigate to the history of the dish, another would be to take the user to the recipe in the application, and another would be to “break down” the dish and splitting it into different layers such a visual representation of the ingredients needed, or a series of images documenting the process of making that dish to the end result that the users see on the page. In this case, AR would have a purpose to it that aids in not only the creativity component of the app but also increase and implement cultural understanding that I want to bring across through my project.   

Schafer’s project also inspired me to consider the idea of rolling back time. When thinking about how my project could take idea from this piece of art, I thought of the different ways in which time plays a role in my piece. It firstly represents the history of the dishes, also a big theme in Gheorghiu and Stefan’s piece. As well, it represents the process of food making. In regard to the former representation, since I already want to share the history of the foods in some way, rather than it being a simple blob of text as I had originally thought, there could be a scroll bar/timeline that users can interact with to move through each phase of development of the dish. This idea could be combined with the previous thought that I had about allowing users to interact with the augmentations. For the process of food making, it could be simply showcasing the different steps of making the dish through an expanding effect where the user clicks onto the dish in the augmentation and it splits up into smaller pictures/parts on a timeline. In these cases, the AR experience is able to bring more knowledge to the user in a more creative way than simple text.
