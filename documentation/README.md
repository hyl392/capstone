# Documentation of Capstone Process
## Week 1
### The week full of question marks, more question marks, and more question marks
Scrapping an idea and coming up with a completely new one is honestly kind of scary. I'm just glad that this process literally came before Capstone Seminar even began. Due to not being on campus and having access to a "large" open space and without the materials that I usually would have access to, I decided to switch from a physical project to producing something that is smaller in scale and more feasible for me to accomplish from home.   

### Inspiration
Being home for the summer and currently as Fall semester starts made one thing really clear for me: time doesn't stop for anyone. 

Since as far as my memory extends, my grandma has always been an amazing cook and displayed her skills evidently every time we would visit by cooking up a big feast. Sometimes, not even the dining table could fit all the dishes. In the past few years, although her love for cooking holds strong, her ability to do so has slowly diminished. Most often now, instead of cooking herself, she would watch on the side and guide (more like dictate) the cooking. 

I want to document this love of hers in a way that is more than a recipe book.   

### Idea
A recipe book of my grandma's famous dishes accompanied with a mobile app that includes an AR/image scanning feature. Both the book and the app could be standalone projects, but combining the two together brings more features e.g. scanning a page in the book --> directs to a step-by-step video of cooking the dish

### Class discussion
Sharing my idea with the class was very helpful because it allowed me to think about details a lot more deeply, especially when it comes to thinking about my project's audience.
* how can I include a storytelling aspect to my project? how do I make the story more than applicable to myself/family? do I need the story to be applicable to anybody beyond?
* who is my audience exactly? perhaps Taiwanese/Hakka students living abroad or descendants living abroad

Ideas I will look more into:
* acute APP --> artists with AR pieces
* social practice art --> bringing food to galleries

### Prototype
For this week, one of my goals is to come up with a list of dishes that I want to potentially include in my project. In the style of my grandma, recipes will be from all courses, culminating to a full course meal. Below is are pictures of lists (in Chinese but will be translated!) of main courses, soups, desserts that I could include.

I also wanted to get things started on the layout and features of the app that I want to create. I've started to look into creating prototypes of mobile apps through InVision Studio and hope to get started using this once I have some features planned out and a potential layout.

### Next steps 

1. Narrow down options, organise filming and phototaking of the dishes    
1. Work out app details, what I want to include in the app as features and layout -- document this    
1. Work out the logistics of making the book, I'm thinking of using Adobe InDesign or something of the sort   

## Week 2
### The week full of question marks, more question marks, and more question marks, squared
The feedback that I received last week was pretty helpful in making me think more on what it is exactly that I want to achieve with my project. Although this is something I'm still trying to work out, Gabi and Alex really made me realise how much the audience matters in our projects. The questions about who my audience is that stemmed from our first Capstone Seminar class still looms over my project. I think for now it will be a looming question, and it won't be until I really get to the more intense designing part of the project for me to decide the answer to that question. 

### Prototype
For this week, my goal was to start wireframing and thinking about how I want my features to be laid out for both the book and the app and which interactions I wanted to include. I'm still trying to get my hands on technology that I think would really help me in my design process, but in the meantime brainstorming and wireframing will be my main focus points.
