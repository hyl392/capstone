## <a name="week1"></a> Week 1
### The week full of question marks, more question marks, and more question marks
Scrapping an idea and coming up with a completely new one is honestly kind of scary. I'm just glad that this process literally came before Capstone Seminar even began. Due to not being on campus and having access to a "large" open space and without the materials that I usually would have access to, I decided to switch from a physical project to producing something that is smaller in scale and more feasible for me to accomplish from home.   

### Inspiration
Being home for the summer and currently as Fall semester starts made one thing really clear for me: time doesn't stop for anyone. 

Since as far as my memory extends, my grandma has always been an amazing cook and displayed her skills evidently every time we would visit by cooking up a big feast. Sometimes, not even the dining table could fit all the dishes. In the past few years, although her love for cooking holds strong, her ability to do so has slowly diminished. Most often now, instead of cooking herself, she would watch on the side and guide (more like dictate) the cooking. 

I want to document this love of hers in a way that is more than a recipe book.   

### Idea
A recipe book of my grandma's famous dishes accompanied with a mobile app that includes an AR/image scanning feature. Both the book and the app could be standalone projects, but combining the two together brings more features e.g. scanning a page in the book --> directs to a step-by-step video of cooking the dish

### Class discussion
Sharing my idea with the class was very helpful because it allowed me to think about details a lot more deeply, especially when it comes to thinking about my project's audience.
* how can I include a storytelling aspect to my project? how do I make the story more than applicable to myself/family? do I need the story to be applicable to anybody beyond?
* who is my audience exactly? perhaps Taiwanese/Hakka students living abroad or descendants living abroad

Ideas I will look more into:
* acute APP --> artists with AR pieces
* social practice art --> bringing food to galleries

### Prototype
For this week, one of my goals is to come up with a list of dishes that I want to potentially include in my project. In the style of my grandma, recipes will be from all courses, culminating to a full course meal. Below is are pictures of lists (in Chinese but will be translated!) of main courses, soups, desserts that I could include.

I also wanted to get things started on the layout and features of the app that I want to create. I've started to look into creating prototypes of mobile apps through InVision Studio and hope to get started using this once I have some features planned out and a potential layout.

### Next steps 

1. Narrow down options, organise filming and phototaking of the dishes    
1. Work out app details, what I want to include in the app as features and layout -- document this    
1. Work out the logistics of making the book, I'm thinking of using Adobe InDesign or something of the sort

### The week full of question marks, more question marks, and more question marks, squared
The feedback that I received last week was pretty helpful in making me think more on what it is exactly that I want to achieve with my project. Although this is something I'm still trying to work out, Gabi and Alex really made me realise how much the audience matters in our projects. The questions about who my audience is that stemmed from our first Capstone Seminar class still looms over my project. I think for now it will be a looming question, and it won't be until I really get to the more intense designing part of the project for me to decide the answer to that question. 

### Prototype
For this week, my goal was to start wireframing and thinking about how I want my features to be laid out for the app and which interactions I wanted to include. I'm still trying to get my hands on technology that I think would really help me in my design process, but in the meantime brainstorming and wireframing will be my main focus points. 

Here are some of the wireframes that I'm working on and short descriptions of the elements on the pages:

### Next steps 
The next steps are roughly the same from last week's and are as follows:

1. Narrow down options, organise filming and phototaking of the dishes    
1. Work out app details, what I want to include in the app as features and layout -- keep working on the wireframes    
1. Work out the logistics of making the book, I'm thinking of using Adobe InDesign or something of the sort

### The week where I started putting things together
The feedback that I received last week gave me a lot of new ideas for features that I could potentially include in my project. Particularly, adding audio in the app to potentially allow the experience of using the app to be more nostalgic and sharing memories associated with the recipes, perhaps through an AR version of a re-telling of the stories. 

### Prototype
This week, I started to use InVision Studio to visualise a part of my app that I had drawn up last week. I focused on the Main Section #2 and #3 (seen in the above photos from last week's prototype). This is obviously a very rough idea with minimal design elements of what I want the structure to kind of be like.

Here is a video of the interactions that I have between the two pages so far:

### Prototype
This week, I continued to work on my prototype that I started to work on in Week 3. However, to showcase the progress that I made this week, after talking to Heather during our meeting, I wanted to document the some of the ways I want users to enjoy the experiences that I am creating. I decided that a fun way to do so would be through a comic strip. 

<img src="https://github.com/hyl392/capstone/blob/master/documentation/images/week4_1.jpg" width="50%"><img src="https://github.com/hyl392/capstone/blob/master/documentation/images/week4_2.jpg" width="50%"><img src="https://github.com/hyl392/capstone/blob/master/documentation/images/week4_3.jpg" width="50%"> 

I first wanted to try and draw using the iPad, but without an Apple Pencil I realised how hard this was and so decided to do so on paper. However, I couldn't manage to scan the pages clear enough and so had to draw some bits over again on the iPad. I hope that the quality doesn't hinder the ability to understand the comic though!

## <a name="week5"></a>Week 5
### Reflection/questions/ideas from meeting with Heather that I must note down
* Is the book redundant if the app can do everything that the book does and even more? What is it that is highlighted in the book that is not in the app?
* Is it a recipe app or an AR experience? If it's an AR experience, what exactly is the experience?
* Overlayed cooking --> potential AR experience?

### How researching artists for the artist paper inspired me (copied from my reflection in my paper)
From Thiel in particular, the idea of allowing users to interact with the augmented images to find out the information that the experience was created to reveal in the first place is an interesting concept. The users are in charge of their experiences and have freedom in choosing the trajectories and the ways in which they view the experience, however, the experiences are already carefully curated by the artist Thiel herself. I think that allowing users some sort of “own discovery” makes the process a lot more memorable because the users retain as an active viewer even while the AR experience is running (more than just moving the screen around). I definitely want to use this concept to expose some sort of information, not necessarily injustices and social and environmental challenges like Thiel and Schafer, but perhaps some historical or “immaterial heritage” like Gheorghiu and Stefan did. From Gheorghiu and Stefan, I really like the idea of having fractals where a series of new images will replace the original to reveal something even deeper or new. With regards to how I can introduce these ideas into my Capstone, I’m envisioning having a process where when users scan an image of a dish in the recipe book, a series of augmented options pop out. For example, one of these options would be to navigate to the history of the dish, another would be to take the user to the recipe in the application, and another would be to “break down” the dish and splitting it into different layers such a visual representation of the ingredients needed, or a series of images documenting the process of making that dish to the end result that the users see on the page. In this case, AR would have a purpose to it that aids in not only the creativity component of the app but also increase and implement cultural understanding that I want to bring across through my project.   

Schafer’s project also inspired me to consider the idea of rolling back time. When thinking about how my project could take idea from this piece of art, I thought of the different ways in which time plays a role in my piece. It firstly represents the history of the dishes, also a big theme in Gheorghiu and Stefan’s piece. As well, it represents the process of food making. In regard to the former representation, since I already want to share the history of the foods in some way, rather than it being a simple blob of text as I had originally thought, there could be a scroll bar/timeline that users can interact with to move through each phase of development of the dish. This idea could be combined with the previous thought that I had about allowing users to interact with the augmentations. For the process of food making, it could be simply showcasing the different steps of making the dish through an expanding effect where the user clicks onto the dish in the augmentation and it splits up into smaller pictures/parts on a timeline. In these cases, the AR experience is able to bring more knowledge to the user in a more creative way than simple text.


## <a name="week6"></a>Week 6
### General reflection
I think my Capstone process so far has been quite slow because I had a lot of question marks in my mind that I couldn't really figure out the answer to. I realise that I was dwelling on figuring out detailed answers in the hope that once I started doing the heavy work, I wouldn’t have to “waste my efforts”. However, I think this is the wrong mentality and that I should start to create and make real certain ideas that I have rather than to just think about them. I think something that is really hindering me from working much on my Capstone is that I’m worried that I don’t have the necessary skills to implement the AR components that make the experience “interesting”, but of course, if I don’t try I’ll never know, so it’s better to get started with it in the first place. 

### What have I made so far?
I have started the process of making the recipe book and have also started filming the dishes. I realised that if I were to be back on campus next semester, I’d have to capture all the cooking components this semester before I leave so that I could do something with them and have content for when I have to actually create the App and have content. I narrowed down the dishes that I had brainstormed in the first week to about 10. In terms of the historical and cultural aspects of the book and the app, I still haven’t narrowed down what it is I want to include but this is something I will most definitely have narrowed down after speaking in-depth with my grandma. 

Example: 

<img src="https://github.com/hyl392/capstone/blob/master/documentation/images/week6.png" width="50%"> 

I have also started the process of working with Unity to play around with the image recognition feature to try and understand how the AR features I have envisioned in my artist paper are feasible. The artist paper gave me a lot of ideas that I want to try and prototype out to see how the user interactions are and to see if it makes sense to include. This will definitely be a priority. 

In regards to the app itself, I have also played around with the features and the layout a little. However, this part is very subject to change as I think I’m changing the purpose of the app itself. I have continued to sketch out ideas as I have them. I've realised that what I have prototyped here so far is not how I now envision the project to be like anymore and so will change this accordingly. 

### Getting feedback
I wanted to get some feedback and ideas from others with whom I haven't talked to them about my Capstone before just so that I could get another perspective on my project and my ideas. I have talked to a few people so far and have had some interesting discussions regarding the purpose of the book and the purpose of the app and what they can do together. Originally I had wanted the app to be a stand alone app where without the book, the app could still function on its own. However, I have decided to restrict the app being a standalone in that I want the users to be using it with the book most of the time, i.e. some of the features would only be available if the book was used as well. I have found and realised that I really want the book to play a role in my project, even though it just seems like a not-so-technological piece. 

### Next steps:
I think what would really give me inspiration for the different AR components that I could implement in the app is by having an interview with my grandma. I think because this is her story and love that I want to document, I should have an in depth conversation with her about everything so that I really portray “her” through the app. 

I need to start working on the Unity components and play around with those and focus less on the design aspects as I do think whatever I need to get done in Unity is the most important right now to figure out. I definitely want to experiment with the idea of overlaid cooking, where the user is able to use their phone to check whether what they are cooking aligns with what it’s supposed to look like. I have a collection of images and videos that I have filmed so far that I could grab to experiment with this.

### Working on the filming/photographing process and recipe book
This week I mainly focused on getting the initial parts of Unity to work (albeit it running very slowly), but mostly working on the filming process and the recipe book. I'm planning to get the filming done this month so I can get started on the Unity and app part more intensely after this.

### Getting started with Unity and more designing, preparing for the extended critique
This week, I allocated some Capstone work time to sorting out my budget and figuring out the equipment and items that I would need to make my project come to fruition. In addition to this week, I finally got Unity to run properly on my laptop since I first installed it. Since my extended critique is this week, I wanted to try to create something that I could show to the class in addition to the designs that I have just explained through words, and sometimes through drawings. Part of preparing the slides for the extended critique was also creating images of the designs that I was envisioning. I think this the process of putting these images together gave myself a better idea of the feasibility of each design as well as the concepts in general. I'm honestly really looking forward to getting in-depth feedback from my peers as I think it would really help me gain more motivation and momemtum to work on my project. 

<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LhDIzRYIvks_4jW8fRf1DZfsqTVhSi7iMQzT5S34huA/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is the link to the presentation that I have prepared for my extended critique.

### Prototype
I have included here two images that I have added into my presentation. These two are two of the AR uses that I came up with after doing my artist research paper.

### Extended critique feedback
This next part is just my documenting of all the comments that I noted down when during my extended critique. 

What does it look like:
- cookbook and app
- cookbook about grandma’s recipes 
- share grandma’s love for cooking
- homemade vibe to it -aesthetics of being something close to home
    - speaks on a more intimate level 
    - impression of the grandmother 
    - personal touch
    - keep plate and cutting board!
    - aesthetic food with homesy vibe — contrast was nice
- feature of comparing, does my food look right now — super different from other cookbooks
    - timeline — pauses can have interviews with grandma 

Themes and content:
- strong theme of feeling homesick — maybe include some "inside jokes" that are recognised by taiwanese
- archiving the culture of people, document family history and legacy 
    - artifact that will be there always 
- counter movement to instagram food bloggers, not the point of the food = rebellion 

What does it mean?
- relatability — extended family ties, series of local cookbooks around the world —> globalising 
    - https://www.bonappetit.com/story/recipe-writing-whitewashed
- add your own recipe?
    - more social —> connecting people with the same background 
    - upload their results
    - reviews 
    - expat doesn’t have ingredients available — having a note from another person about foods that can’t be brought about replacements 
        - notes 
- personal — users dont need to interact — like how its personal, emerges modern technology with traditional aspects 
    - valuable aspects, write your own tips in the cookbook 
- how social do i want to make the app 
    - goal of connecting expats: people nearby who are cooking this recipe or looking at it 
- be cautious of social part - heather 
    - moderation concerns 
    - limited interactions — express not hate but love 
- important to not be marketed as taiwanese cuisine and this is how my grandma makes it 
    - a lot more interesting to focus on the personal details 

How well does it succeed?
- succeeds of targeting Taiwanese expats 
    - second generation — link to grandma and grandpa 
- gradual progress of how to cook the meal and the progress
    - hardest part of cooking is knowing process 
- clearer to see a video 
    - value of sound — sizzling sounds 
- plane resolution opacity/ translucent 
    - won’t be able to see through it well 
    - mixed up if ontop overlay 
- stories
- stressed cooking, touching 
- audio file, real time audio step by step cooking 
    - podcast about the food 
- interview language,
    - toggles for switching between languages 

Sum-up:
- Possibility of making the app more social -- open for the user to share 
- Keep the homemade vibe to it 
- Involve different types of multimedia into the project (i.e. audio, video)

### Consolidation of project budget
I have finally got a rough enough estimate of the amount of money that I would need to do book printing for my project and have finished the last of my budget items list. Hopefully, I'll be able to send this out soon. 

### Prototype
This week, I was working on a prototype for the tab system that I have in my app, as well as filming some more food shots and videos. 
Below is a very rough tab system picture with arbitrary colours for the tabs for testing purposes.
