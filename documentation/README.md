# Documentation of Capstone Process
## Week 1
### The week full of question marks, more question marks, and more question marks
Scrapping an idea and coming up with a completely new one is honestly kind of scary. I'm just glad that this process literally came before Capstone Seminar even began. Due to not being on campus and having access to a "large" open space and without the materials that I usually would have access to, I decided to switch from a physical project to producing something that is smaller in scale and more feasible for me to accomplish from home.   

### Inspiration
Being home for the summer and currently as Fall semester starts made one thing really clear for me: time doesn't stop for anyone. 

Since as far as my memory extends, my grandma has always been an amazing cook and displayed her skills evidently every time we would visit by cooking up a big feast. Sometimes, not even the dining table could fit all the dishes. In the past few years, although her love for cooking holds strong, her ability to do so has slowly diminished. Most often now, instead of cooking herself, she would watch on the side and guide (more like dictate) the cooking. 

I want to document this love of hers in a way that is more than a recipe book.   

### Idea
A recipe book of my grandma's famous dishes accompanied with a mobile app that includes an AR/image scanning feature. Both the book and the app could be standalone projects, but combining the two together brings more features e.g. scanning a page in the book --> directs to a step-by-step video of cooking the dish

### Class discussion
Sharing my idea with the class was very helpful because it allowed me to think about details a lot more deeply, especially when it comes to thinking about my project's audience.
(insert summary here)   

### Prototype
For this week, one of my goals is to come up with a list of dishes that I want to potentially include in my project. In the style of my grandma, recipes will be from all courses, culminating to a full course meal. Below is are pictures of lists (in Chinese but will be translated!) of main courses, soups, desserts that I could include.
