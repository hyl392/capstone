# Capstone
### AR EXPERIENCE 
### Grandma's Recipes
My Capstone is a cookbook accompanied with a mobile app that attempts to teach users how to cook certain dishes through an AR experience. The recipe book would be made into the cookbook style that is familiar with everyone, and the app will also include other elements that make the experience more wholesome. This project it dedicated to my grandma, who is an amazing cook, and to students abroad who are missing the taste of home.
